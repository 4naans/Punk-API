The purpose of this site is to allow users to easily browse through the range of Brewdog products, provided by Brewdogs A.P.I catalgoue. THe site includes a search box as well as a filter function to selectively reduce the number of beers displayed. I also implented a clickability feature on each of the individual beer tiles, meaning that when clicked you are provided with a desciprtion of the product. 

This was another projected assigned to me on the _Nology coding course in order to improve and expand my skillset. The technologies I used when working on this project were HTML5, SASS, React and Postman. My learning curve was rather steep when beginning the coure as I had never had any prior experience in coding, however it was on this project were I felt something click and everything started to come together. Working with React allowed me to gain a lot of confidence in each of the different languages and I thouroughly enjoyed getting this project to work in it's entirety.

The original brief gave a component tree for basic design reference along with a data.js file holding information on 20 individual beers. Once this was implemented by using the data file to map over the card info, I removed the data file provided and linked the gallery up to the Brewdog API giving it full access to the entire catalogue of beverages.

The filter and searchbox function can be used to re-render the page so that it only displays beers which either include the search term, and are filtered depending on the year they were brewed or their alcohol content. This was achieved using different URL end-point provided by the Brewdog API which I investigated using Postman.
